B.A.R.I.C.A. Contributing
=========================

B.A.R.I.C.A. is an ongoing initiative by the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the
Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb as well as affiliated
students, faculty and others with the common objective to teach AI methods to anyone
who wants to learn them. In that regard, anyone is welcome to contribute!

The main idea behing B.A.R.I.C.A. is to establish an open source AI system for various
types of systems including but not limited to intelligent assistents, Internet of Thing,
autonomous vehicles and similar. In that regard B.A.R.I.C.A. is a cloud based system
that includes a module system for various tricks B.A.R.I.C.A. can learn.

B.A.R.I.C.A. is currently in a pre-Alpha stage, and thus any contribution is very welcome!

Contributing to the Backend
---------------------------

The backend system (the cloud) is the heart of B.A.R.I.C.A. and is envisaged as a distributed
AI system that allows clients to access various knowledge modules (tricks) for their 
applications.

In order to contribute, just review the issues on GitHub and post a comment if you find 
anything of interest.

Contributing modules
--------------------

Modules in B.A.R.I.C.A. are usually various kinds of little (or not so little) programs
that allow B.A.R.I.C.A. to do new and interesting stuff. You can review the *dummy* and
*dummy_stream* module to get a glimpse of how such modules function.

In order to contribute a module, feel free to open a new issue (feature request) on GitHub 
and describe what you would like to do.

Contributing client applications
--------------------------------

Client applications can be very different and use various modules available. They can use the
REST API, the Web Socket API and/or the straming API to access various tricks B.A.R.I.C.A. can
do.
