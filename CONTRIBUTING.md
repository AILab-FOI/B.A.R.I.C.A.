that includes a module system for various tricks B.A.R.I.C.A. can learn.

B.A.R.I.C.A. is currently in a pre-Alpha stage, and thus any contribution is very welcome!

Contributing to the Backend
---------------------------

The backend system (the cloud) is the heart of B.A.R.I.C.A. and is envisaged as a distributed
AI system that allows clients to access various knowledge modules (tricks) for their 
applications.

In order to contribute, just review the issues on GitHub and post a comment if you find 
anything of interest.

Contributing Modules
--------------------

Modules in B.A.R.I.C.A. are usually various kinds of little (or not so little) programs
that allow B.A.R.I.C.A. to do new and interesting stuff. You can review the *dummy* and
*dummy_stream* module to get a glimpse of how such modules function.
