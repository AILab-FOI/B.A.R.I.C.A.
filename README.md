# B.A.R.I.C.A.
B.A.R.I.C.A. is an acronym standing for "Beautiful ARtificial Intelligence Cognitive Agent" designed to act as a platform for various AI related applications including but not limited to autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants and gamified cognitive agents. Playing with acronyms is fun, but really Barica is a traditional name from Hrvatsko Zagorje, a northern part of Croatia where our Faculty resides.

Since 2019. B.A.R.I.C.A. is developed through funding from the Faculty of Organization and Informatics and the Croatian Science Foundation.

This work has been supported in part by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number [IP-2019-04-5824](http://dragon.foi.hr:8888/ohai4games).
