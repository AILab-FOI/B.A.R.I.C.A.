# B.A.R.I.C.A.
B.A.R.I.C.A. is an acronym standing for "Beautiful ARtificial Intelligence Cognitive Agent" designed to act as a platform for various AI related applications including but not limited to autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants and gamified cognitive agents. Playing with acronyms is fun, but really Barica is a traditional name from Hrvatsko Zagorje, a northern part of Croatia where our Faculty resides.

Since 2019. B.A.R.I.C.A. is developed through funding from the Faculty of Organization and Informatics and the Croatian Science Foundation.
